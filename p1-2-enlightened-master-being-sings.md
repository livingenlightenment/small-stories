_A disciple asked a Zen[^1] master, ‘Does
an enlightened master speak?’_

_The master said, ‘No, an enlightened
person never speaks. Only a person
who doesn’t know enlightenment
speaks.’_

_Then the disciple asked, ‘So does an
enlightened master keep quiet?’_

_The master
said, ‘No, an
enlightened
master never
keeps quiet. If
he keeps
quiet, then he is not enlightened.’_

_The disciple was puzzled. He asked,
‘You say he neither speaks nor keeps
quiet. What does he do?’_

_The master replied, ‘He sings! His being
sings. He neither speaks, nor keeps
quiet. His very being sings.’_
