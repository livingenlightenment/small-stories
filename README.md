"An Enlightened master is a singing being"

A disciple asked a Zen master,
‘Does an enlightened master speak?’
The master said, ‘No, an enlightened person never speaks.
Only a person who doesn’t know enlightenment speaks.’

Then the disciple asked, ‘So does an enlightened master keep quiet?’
The master said, ‘No, an enlightened master never keeps quiet.
If he keeps quiet, then he is not enlightened.’

The disciple was puzzled.
He asked, ‘You say he neither speaks nor keeps quiet. What does he do?’

The master replied,
‘He sings! His being sings.
He neither speaks, nor keeps quiet.
His very being sings.’
