_A school boy fell in love with a girl from
his own grade._

_One day he was kidnapped by an
extremist group and sent to a camp
across the border for training. A few
months later he came back to his
homeland to spread terror._

_He entered his village to find that the
family of his beloved was killed by
terrorists._

_He met the girl and they started talking.
She told him how much she hated what
was happening and begged him to stop
what he was doing. She told him she
would marry him only if he surrendered
to the authorities._

_The boy
immediately
surrendered
and joined the
army fighting
the insurgency while carrying a
photograph of the girl in his pocket all
the time._
